## What is this?
This is a weather forecasting website for the US, built from scratch for a school project. This website includes two pages, the first with a search bar and a simple history card holder, and the second with a searchbar/history column on the left and the search results or city weather data on the right. When you search up a city, you are presented with the search results. All searches are restricted to the US When you click on the city you are looking for, you are presented with current weather data and a 5 day forecast for that city. When you click a history link, either on the home page or the search page, you are taken to the weather data and 5 day forecast of the city the history link is associated with. This project uses openweathermap current weater, geocoding, and 5 day 3 hour forecast api's.

## For Grading Staff
Here's a list of everything I remember getting from outside sources
- List of states and their cities
- index splice code to remove unwanted history array items
- the state code list
- The way to get the dates of the days directly after the current date
- The idea to set up a for loop as (i = totalAmount; i > 0; i--;)
- There may have been a few other small ones but I spent a lot of time working on this So I don't remember them

  Also, I apologize for the mess that my code is. I got to a point where I myself could barely make my way through it but I didn't revise or comment through any of it because I wanted to finish this before the first collaberative project and I was rushing myself. I definitely learned a lot from this on structuring my code however, and I don't plan on making the same mistakes.
